Steps needed to create a new package:

Given module name (e.g., Some::Module) perform the following steps.

  Convert name to match arch requirements (perl-some-module).
  Create and change directory, copy skel files and make any changes.
  Determine distribution page (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Some::Module is a good bet).
  Create PKGBUILD (see below).

Steps needed to update an existing package:

  Check if module has an update (source? perhaps download 02packages.txt first?).
  Check if there are any bugs or notifications against package on AUR.
  Create PKGBUILD (see below).

Steps needed to create PKGBUILD

  Find and download latest source tarball.
  Determine or calculate required fields for PKGBUILD.
