aur-packages
============

aur packages I need that haven't been created yet, or that I needed to modify,
or that I've adopted or otherwise maintain.

NOTE: The 'notmaintainer' directory contains packages that are not mine and
that the maintainer, for whatever reason, is not updating.

notes
=====

perl-cpan-meta needs to be updated, which is affecting perl-cpan-meta-check
and perl-cpan-meta-requirements
